"""
    When fine-tuning, it's helpful to have variations of the user's questions to make sure
    we have enough examples of how people might ask the same question.

    This program reads in our Q&A document and asks GPT to generate 10 variations for us.
    We then write out the original question and answer as well as 10 new Q&As (where the
    answer remains the same).
